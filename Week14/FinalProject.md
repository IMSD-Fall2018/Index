Hello class! Here are the details for your final project, using Unity to grab and visualize data from the internet.

## Overview
+  It must be a Unity project
+  That fetches data from an API
+  And does something interesting and meaningful with the result
+  It can be user-interactive, or play out on its own, but it shouldn't be static
+  You can use the weather API if you really want to, but you have to do something significantly different than the example project
+  The example project from class yesterday is posted here: https://github.com/IMSD-Fall2018/Index/tree/master/Week14
+  You will be graded on 1) Your use of Unity and C# script writing, 2) The originality of your idea 3) The execution of the result.
+  A functioning build of the game, and accompanying artists statement, will be due on Monday, December 14th

## Due Monday, December 3rd:
Write a proposal for your project and upload it your git, named "dataviz.md", include:
+  A general explanation of your idea
+  A sketch of what it might look like
+  Break down what you will need to do technically to achieve this project-
+  +  What do you already know how to do?
+  +  What do you not know how to do?
+  What realtime data you are using and why
+  Test the API and ensure you can get output you need (in browser)
